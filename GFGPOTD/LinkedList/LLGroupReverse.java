// Given the head a linked list, the task is to reverse every k node in the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then the left-out nodes in the end, should be considered as a group and must be reversed.

// Examples:

// Input: head = 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8, k = 4
// Output: 4 -> 2 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8 -> 7 -> 6 -> 5

// Explanation: The first 4 elements 1, 2, 2, 4 are reversed first and then the next 4 elements 5, 6, 7, 8. Hence, the resultant linked list is 4 -> 2 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8 -> 7 -> 6 -> 5.
// Input: head = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, k = 3
// Output: 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4

// Explanation: The first 3 elements 1, 2, 3 are reversed first and then left out elements 4, 5 are reversed. Hence, the resultant linked list is 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4.
